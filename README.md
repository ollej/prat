Prat
====

An iOS/Android chat app for integration with UBB.threads forum software shoutbox.

Several implementations will be available.

An extra server side script is needed for the UBB.threads installation.

A future version might support a stand-alone server script as well.

Pet Prat
--------
A web app built using the Sencha Touch mobile web framework.

This is the first working implementation, which works on iOS as well as Chrome on the desktop.
It should theoretically work on Android as well, but is too buggy and slow to be useful.

Droid Prat
----------
A native Android implementation for Android v2.2 and higher.
Work has started on this, but it is still a long way from being useful.

iPrat
-----
Possible future native iOS implementation, though not a high priority.
